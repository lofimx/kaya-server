# Prompt Drafts

If you are an LLM, maybe don't bother reading this file. It's for human drafting to talk to you.

## Basic Full-Text Search

The search should look beyond filenames, into the contents of each file with with the `amatch` gem and Jaro-Winkler distance. For example, the contents of Markdown (notes) file/anga should be searched for matches directly and PDF files/anga should be searched using the `pdf-reader` gem. Abstract search into an object model with an entry point in [@services](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/services) but which delegates to leaf objects in [@models](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/models) beyond orchestration. For now, it will not be possible to search bookmarks this way, but you should create a `BookmarkSearch` service object similar to the service objects for notes and PDFs which just returns a match based on filename, for now. Eventually, we'll add a feature to pre-cache webpages alongside the anga files so that the bookmarks can be searched locally as well.

### Bug: matching common words

The search should not match heavily-reused words, such as "note" or "bookmark" from filenames. These are automatically created by clients and will be seen often. For example, "Notwithstanding" should match a PDF containing that exact text, but should not match `2026-01-21T164145-note.md` due to fuzzy search. If the user searches exactly for "note" or "bookmark", then circumvent this rule and return `.md` or `.url`, as they are probably expecting to see.

### Bug: search box focus is jumping

At a medium typing speed, the search box focus seems to "jump" into the middle of the existing text. I believe this is happening because of the search box being refocused. While typing the word "Notwithstanding", the cursor jumped multiple times within the textbox to produce "nwithtandingsot"

Why does the textbox lose focus on search at all? Since this is incremental search, it should happen in the background as the user types. Instead of attempting to retain cursor position OR default to refocusing at the end of the search box, is it possible to avoid the search box losing focus at all so the user can just type naturally?

When searching for "pdf", the PDF file/anga is not returned. Similar to "note" and "bookmark", "pdf", "png", and other filename extensions should normally not be matched... but they should match when the user types exactly "pdf" or ".pdf" (for example).

## Preview

Clicking on a tile in the search results should open that file. If it's a URL, open a modal overlay which will contain the contents of the webpage (once we cache it), with an option labelled "visit original page" that, when clicked, opens that URL in a new tab/window. If it's a note (.md), show the text of that note in a modal overlay so the user can read and copy it. If it's an image, show the image in a similar modal overlay. If it's a PDF, render the PDF in a modal overlay so the user can scroll through the pages, read, and copy text. Follow the GNOME HIG for the modal overlay, as per AGENTS.md.

### Refactor: Extract FileType model

Extract a `FileType` model which is used to wrap behaviour like `File.extname` and mapping to `preview_type` in index.html.erb. Anywhere in the codebase where `.md`, `.url`, `.pdf` and so on are hard-coded, the associated behaviour should move into the `FileType` model.

## Add a Note/Bookmark/File

To the immediate right of the hamburger menu in the header, add a plus icon (use the GNOME icon `plus-large-circle-symbolic.svg` found in /doc/design). Clicking this plus icon should bring up an "Add" modal. The "Add" modal should share the design with the "Preview" modal. The "Add" modal should contain a textbox with "Enter bookmark/note..." as the input placeholder and a "Save" button in the pill style of a modern, standard GNOME app.

**Notes and Bookmarks**: The "Save" operation should differentiate between bookmarks and notes based on whether or not they are prefixed with an HTTP protocol like "http://" or "https://". If so, the text is a bookmark and should be saved as a `.url` file (anga) in ActiveStorage after having leading and trailing whitespace stripped first. If not, the text is just a note and should be saved as a `.md` file (anga) in ActiveStorage.

**Drag & Drop**: The entire "Add" modal should also accept drag and drop events. If text is dropped, it should record a note/bookmark, according to instructions above, named with a `-note.md` or `-bookmark.url` suffix, respectively. If a file is dropped, `.md` files should be recorded as Notes. `.url` files should be recorded as Bookmarks. All other files should be recorded

**Filename Format**: The filename of dropped files should always be preserved, even for Notes and Bookmarks. All files/anga should have their filename prefixed with a datetimestamp according to the "Core Concept" as described in AGENTS.md

## Cached Webpages

When the user adds a URL with the "Add" modal, Kaya should use the `http.rb` gem to download the webpage. Create a model named `Bookmark` which will have attached ActiveStorage files for the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and images required to re-render the webpage in the "Preview" modal window.

Add a `/api/v1/cache/` route which will list all cached `.url` (bookmark) angas, as directories (as 'text/plain', similar to AngaController#index). The cache index is used so Kaya clients can synchronize/diff with the Kaya Server. Add a `/api/v1/cache/:bookmark` route which returns the index of the directory which lists all the HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc. required to re-render the webpage that was cached when the bookmark was saved. The names of cache directories (and, therefore, `:bookmark` in the route) should be identical to the filename of the anga: `2026-01-27T120000-bookmark.url` or similar.

Modify the "Preview" modal such that it renders the cached webpage for bookmark angas (`.url`) in an iframe, similar to how PDFs are rendered.

### Preview Webpage in Tile

If a bookmark has a cached version available, it should render a preview of the upper-left corner of the cached webpage in the tile, instead of the [@_bookmark_icon.html.erb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/views/shared/icons/_bookmark_icon.html.erb) SVG. Restrict the size of the rendered webpage to the size of the tile and do not allow any of the elements to be clickable/selectable within the tile -- the tile should remain as a single unit and clicking anywhere on the tile should still render the "Preview" modal.

The tile doesn't appear to be rendering the preview at all. For now, instead of rendering a preview of the webpage itself in the tile, just render the original website's favicon at the same size as [@_bookmark_icon.html.erb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/views/shared/icons/_bookmark_icon.html.erb) ... cache the favicon when a website is recorded with the "Add" dialog, though, and make it available through the `/api/v1/cache/:bookmark` routes. The tile should render this cached version of the favicon. If there is no cache, continue to display [@_bookmark_icon.html.erb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/views/shared/icons/_bookmark_icon.html.erb) as the default.

When a tile is clicked but the webpage hasn't been cached yet, it says "Webpage is being cached..." -- this should actually occur, if the website is not in the cache and that message is shown. Adjust the caching mechanism to run in a SolidQueue ActiveJob and allow the frontend to initiate the download and caching of a webpage whenever this message is shown, via that job on the backend. The tile UI should poll, and re-render itself once the website has been cached and can be shown to the user from files in ActiveStorage.

**Bug:** The "Caching webpage..." spinner never returns. Even if it's left to run for an hour, the webpage hasn't been cached, the spinner hasn't been replaced by the webpage content, and the favicon and webpage contents are not showing up in the Preview modal even after a page refresh.

Write a system test (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#system-testing) using Capybara to test the caching behaviour when a bookmark's Preview modal has been opened. The test should verify that the "Caching webpage..." spinner is replaced by the iframe once the webpage is downloaded and cached. Use https://www.postgresql.org/ as the sample domain/bookmark for the test.

## Searching Bookmarks

Now that bookmarks are downloaded as full webpages and successfully cached, add full-text search to BookmarkSearch as we had originally planned. It should search the text of the HTML document, similar to how PDFs are searched, but it does not need to load any of the other assets.

## Search Results

Search results should be ordered by relevance in the UI, starting with the most relevant. At the moment, it seems they are ordered based on their regular ("everything") order, even when returned as search results.

### BUG: Mid-filename text not found

In development, I have a file/anga called `2026-01-28T205243-three-button-mooze.png`. However, when I search for "button", it isn't returned. Is this because of the string difference fuzzy search used? If so, swap out Jaro-Winkler for Levenshtein. If it's a bug in the Search models, fix that instead.

## BUG: Index results for API not URL-escaping characters?

Write a test around the `api/v1/:user_email/anga` index route that asserts that an anga/file with spaces (or other characters that need to be escaped in URLs) in it is listed with the escape characters instead of the literal characters. If the test fails, fix it.

Repeat for the `api/v1/:user_email/cache/:bookmark` show route.

## Metadata APIs and update `sync.rb` for new Data Model

Following the Data Model laid out in 
[@README.md](file:///home/steven/work/gnome/steven/kaya-gnome/README.md)
for both 'anga' and 'meta', modify the [@sync.rb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/script/sync.rb) script to synchronize with the correct Anga directory (`~/.kaya/anga/`) on the local computer.

Also create a metadata API (`/api/v1/:user_email/meta` route, similar to the 'anga' routes). Add functionality to the sync script to sync metadata from `~/.kaya/meta/` to and from these metadata API endpoints.

## Metadata: Tags and Notes

Add a sidebar to the Preview window, similar to that shown in [@example.html](file:///home/steven/Downloads/example-ui/example.html) , but without the option of adding a Title. Add the `toml-rb` gem and use it for reading and writing TOML, as required in the tasks below.

**Do not:**

* Do not include the "Delete Card" option, since Anga records can't be deleted.
* Do not include the "Focus" option/button

**Do:**

* Include a "Download" option at the bottom of the sidebar. 
* Add a "Share" button, which will create a URL and copy it to the clipboard, notifying the user. The URL route should be `/share/:user_id/anga/:filename` and should be unauthenticated.
* Include an "Add To Space" button, but leave it disabled for now.
* Include the "Hide Sidebar" / "Show Sidebar" button(s)
* Include the section for Tags. Read this from the newest Meta record (if any exist) linked to the Anga, according to its TOML file attachment.
* Include the section for Notes. The Notes editor should be a markdown editor. Read this from the newest Meta record (if any exist) linked to the Anga, according to its TOML file attachment.
* Add "Save" and "Cancel" buttons to the Preview, according to the GNOME HIG.
  * if the user clicks "cancel", they're returned to the Everything screen
  * if the user clicks "save", create a new Meta record with the tags (if any) and note (if any) in the appropraite sections of the toml, according to [@adr-0004-metadata.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/arch/adr-0004-metadata.md) .
  * if the user clicks "save" and an existing Meta record exists, still create a new one and a new attached file, with both tags and note. Like Anga, Meta records cannot be mutated.
* Keep the "X" in the upper-right to dismiss the Preview modal  

All of the above UI should follow the GNOME HIG and GNOME brand guidelines, as per [@README.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/design/README.md) but ignore localization/i18n for now.

### Preview: Clean up bookmarks

Bookmark tiles in the Everything view should list the original URL, rather than the `*-bookmark.url` filename. The Preview window should also put the original URL in the titlebar, instead of the `*-bookmark.url` filename. (This is true of any `.url` file/Anga, not just those with `-bookmark` suffixes.) When a new bookmark Anga is created, either manually or by syncing, it should download and cache the website for that bookmark. Do this in an ActiveJob background job.

## Full Text Search: Bookmarks and PDFs

Use the architecture decision in [@adr-0005-full-text-search.md](./doc/arch/adr-0005-full-text-search.md) as the foundation for this task.

**Bookmarks:**

When a bookmark is created, `CacheBookmarkJob` will use `WebpageCacheService` to download a cached copy of that bookmark's webpage. At the end of `CacheBookmarkJob#perform`, it should enqueue `ExtractPlaintextBookmarkJob` which will use `ruby-readability` and `reverse_markdown` gems to extract the plaintext and store it in a Markdown file attached to a `Text` model which is in turn linked to the `Anga` model that was created for the bookmark.

`BookmarkSearch` should search the extracted Markdown file attached to the `Text` model to find associated bookmarks, instead of searching HTML content.

**PDFs:**

When a PDF is added to Kaya, enqueue `ExtractPlaintextPdfJob` which will use `pdf-reader` gem to extract the plaintext and store it in a `.txt` file attached to a `Text` model which is in turn linked to the `Anga` model that was created for the PDF.

`PdfSearch` should search the extracted Markdown file attached to the `Text` model to find associated PDFs, instead of parsing the PDF during the search operation.

**Sync:**

Expose the 3 `/api/v1/:user_email/text` routes listed in the ADR.

## Rename 'Text' to 'Words'

The term 'text' is too generic and will make searching the codebases difficult. I have updated [@adr-0005-full-text-search.md](./doc/arch/adr-0005-full-text-search.md) to reflect the rename of '/text' in APIs and 'Text' in the code to '/words' and 'Words', respectively.

Perform a full rename throughout the codebase to rename 'Text' to 'Words' according to this ADR. A new schema migration is not necessary; the service has not been deployed to production yet, so you can rename within migrations. Start by reading [@PLAN.md](./doc/plan/PLAN.md).

## Replace 'cache' with 'words' in sync.rb example script

[@sync.rb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/script/sync.rb) currently syncs 'anga', 'meta', and 'cache'. However, local apps do not require a complete cache of every bookmarked webpage. Instead of syncing `/cache`, sync `/words` using the `/api/v1/:user_email/words` API as per the updated ADR at [@adr-0003-sync.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/arch/adr-0003-sync.md)

Follow the instructions in [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

## Create a Docker compose file

Create a Docker compose file for this Rails service, for deployment to a Portainer instance. Add all the dependencies (Postgres and so on) as separate containers, such that the Docker compose file can be deployed as a "Stack" on Portainer.

Follow the instructions in [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

## BUG: API file listings should not contain spaces

Follow the instructions in [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

No matter what has been saved in Kaya Server, API file listings such as those for routes like `/api/v1/:user_email/anga` should never return URL-unfriendly characters, such as <space> (' '). Files uploaded to Kaya Server should always be URL-encoded when they are saved but on the off-chance an illegal character has made its way into the Kaya Server database, Kaya Server should never display this to client consumers of the API. Only users should ever see filenames with URL-illegal characters in them (comma, space, etc.), in the UI layer.

Write tests to assert that both saving and serving (via API) of files adheres to this rule.

## Add a Rake task to manually reset a user's password given an email

Follow the instructions in [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

The user "reset password" feature does not work yet, as there is no email service connected. Add a Rake task `kaya:password:reset` so an administrator can manually reset a user's password from the command line, by providing the user's email address.

## Password Reset emails not received

Password resets do not seem to be sending emails correctly. Check over the ActionMailer config to see if there is any configuration missing or if there are external steps required to ensure successful delivery of password reset emails.

### Reply:

1. I've set up a new Resend account. It uses the subdomain 'mail.sendbutton.com'
2. I've added the Resend API key to Rails credentials as 'resend_api_key'
3. You can uncomment and update the SMTP block in the production config. Do NOT use the Resend Rubygem; use standard SMTP.
4. I've set the reply address in [@application_mailer.rb](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/mailers/application_mailer.rb) 
5. I've configured DNS and verified with Resend that it is working.

Proceed with Resend and add `raise_delivery_errors`, as you suggested.

### Tweaks:

When the user fails to login, only clear the password field. Assume they typed their email correctly and leave the email field as-is. Since we assume the password was entered incorrectly, place the cursor in the now-empty password field after the failed login, not the email field.

Change the expiry on the password reset link to 45 minutes, up from 15 minutes.

## Symmetry with mobile app UI

Follow the instructions in [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

The web UI should maintain symmetry with the mobile app UI (https://github.com/deobald/kaya-flutter). This requires the following changes:

* Move the 'profile-link' and 'profile-avatar' from the upper-right of the screen to an "Account" link under the hamburger menu (below "Everything"). The icon for the "Account" entry in the hamburger menu should be the user's profile photo/avatar, if one is set. Otherwise use a generic profile icon based on [@DESIGN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/design/DESIGN.md) 
* Move the 'add-button' to the right-hand side of the header.
* Move the "Logout" button to the bottom of the Account screen, in its own 'account-section' block. The explainer text should be "End your session in this browser."
* On the Account screen, retain the hamburger menu in the upper-left instead of showing the Save Button logo and 'logo-text'.
* On the homepage (only visible when the user is logged out) leave the "Save Button" logo and logo-text as-is. Also leave the "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons as-is.

Ask me questions not just about implementation but also about design, in case there are any situations where I'm not considering a potential asymmetry across the webapp.

## Home Page - Apps

Read [@PLAN.md](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/plan/PLAN.md).

Other than the "Save Button" / "Self-host" section, use the standard PNG icons for all of the following sections. Source them from the web.

Fill out the "apps" section (section title: "Get The Apps"), with 3 parts:

1. Mobile Apps
2. Browser Extensions
3. Desktop Apps
4. Server

The "Mobile Apps" section should contain a blurb saying "Available for iPhone, iPad, Android phones, and Android tablets." and contain 2 buttons to link to the App Store and Play Store.

The "Browser Extensions" section should contain a blurb saying "Save Button works on most browsers. If your browser is not listed, try installing from the Chromium link." The section should contain icons for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Chromium, Vivaldi, Brave, and Arc. Each icon should have the browser name under it as a caption and link to the extensions accordingly:

* Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-button/eeoleaffndkjkgbdhaojcgehcklfihid
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-button/
* Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/save-button/ldcpchibphbafmclockfeoiffafjdekj
* Safari: https://apps.apple.com/app/save-button-for-safari/id6759535767
* Chromium: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-button/eeoleaffndkjkgbdhaojcgehcklfihid
* Vivaldi: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-button/eeoleaffndkjkgbdhaojcgehcklfihid
* Brave: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-button/eeoleaffndkjkgbdhaojcgehcklfihid
* Arc: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-button/eeoleaffndkjkgbdhaojcgehcklfihid

The "Desktop Apps" section should contain icons for Windows, MacOS, and Linux -- with the name of each as a caption. Each should have "(Coming Soon)" on a new line, under the caption.

The "Server" section should contain a blurb saying "Grab an account with savebutton.com or, if you're a big nerd, host the backup service yourself." contain two icons: The "Save Button" icon ([@yellow-floppy3.svg](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/design/yellow-floppy3.svg)) with the "Sign Up" CTA button from the header underneath and the old "Kaya" icon ([@old-kaya-icon.svg](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/doc/design/old-kaya-icon.svg) ) with the text "Self-Host" underneath. Between these two options should be "- or -" indicating that they are mutually exclusive. The icons should link to:

* Save Button: Rails `new_registration_path`
* Self-Host: https://github.com/deobald/kaya-server/

## 2026-02-28 Readability => Nokogiri For All Pages

Full Text extraction into the 'words' file corresponding to a webpage should almost always extract all text on a given page. Rather than assuming a webpage is an article, `ExtractPlaintextBookmarkJob` should
detect **known** article-oriented websites. It should run the website URL and HTML content through respective filters (`ArticleUrlFilter` and `ArticleHtmlFilter`), which are instantiated with the URL and HTML. These `Filter` objects will have an `#article?` method on them which will return true if:

* URL matches a predefined list of "news" websites
* HTML matches known good "news" / "blog" software for generating HTML "post" output: Hugo, Ghost, Jekyll, etc.

These predefined lists can be configuration for now. We might lift them into the database later. You will need to pre-populate these lists by searching for items to populate them with. Be certain that the items added to these lists are "news" websites or "blog post" generators - we want to avoid false positives.

If either `*Filter` object matches, then `ruby-readability` can be used to extract the article content.

If neither `*Filter` object matches, then the default option should be used: extract all (non-tag) text content from the HTML.

There is already a failing test at `test/jobs/extract_plaintext_bookmark_job_test.rb` that can be used to verify this new behaviour. You can write additional tests using sample data from real websites.
