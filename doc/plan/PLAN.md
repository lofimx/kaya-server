# Plan Documents

LLM agents must create a Markdown plan document in this directory before adding any feature or performing any refactoring, named with this pattern:

* `2025-12-25-add-job-for-plaintext-indexing.md`
* `2026-01-31-r-extract-behavior-from-controllers-to-models.md` ('r' for 'refactoring')

Before creating the plan, read these documents: 

* [@README.md](./README.md)
* [@AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)
* [doc/design/DESIGN.md](./doc/design/DESIGN.md)
* [doc/arch/*.md](./doc/arch/)

Then create the plan and ask any clarifying questions you have. After I answer your questions to eliminate ambiguity, adjust the plan accordingly. Ask more clarifying questions, if required, and repeat the process until all your questions are answered.
