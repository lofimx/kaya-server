# Prompt Drafts

If you are an LLM, maybe don't bother reading this file. It's for human drafting to talk to you.

## Basic Full-Text Search

The search should look beyond filenames, into the contents of each file with with the `amatch` gem and Jaro-Winkler distance. For example, the contents of Markdown (notes) file/anga should be searched for matches directly and PDF files/anga should be searched using the `pdf-reader` gem. Abstract search into an object model with an entry point in [@services](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/services) but which delegates to leaf objects in [@models](file:///home/steven/work/deobald/kaya-server/app/models) beyond orchestration. For now, it will not be possible to search bookmarks this way, but you should create a `BookmarkSearch` service object similar to the service objects for notes and PDFs which just returns a match based on filename, for now. Eventually, we'll add a feature to pre-cache webpages alongside the anga files so that the bookmarks can be searched locally as well.

### Bug: matching common words

The search should not match heavily-reused words, such as "note" or "bookmark" from filenames. These are automatically created by clients and will be seen often. For example, "Notwithstanding" should match a PDF containing that exact text, but should not match `2026-01-21T164145-note.md` due to fuzzy search. If the user searches exactly for "note" or "bookmark", then circumvent this rule and return `.md` or `.url`, as they are probably expecting to see.

### Bug: search box focus is jumping

At a medium typing speed, the search box focus seems to "jump" into the middle of the existing text. I believe this is happening because of the search box being refocused. While typing the word "Notwithstanding", the cursor jumped multiple times within the textbox to produce "nwithtandingsot"
